	<h1>About YambaII Client</h1>
	<p>
		YambaII is Yet Another Micro Blogging App. It was written to support
		various Marakana <a href="https://marakana.com/training/android/">Android
			training classes</a>, most specifically <a
			href="http://marakana.com/training/android/android_bootcamp.html">Marakana
			Android Bootcamp</a>, and is an evolution of the project from
			 <a href="http://amzn.to/learningandroid"><em>Learning Android</em></a>
			 book written by Marko Gargenta.
	    YambaII has two parts: a front end client and a Content Provider service.
	    Be sure to install the service before trying to use the front-end client.
	    
	    This is the client.
